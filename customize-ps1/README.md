# Customize PS1

These scripts are mainly used to customize the prompt statement (PS1 in
particular) for Git. It shows the current Git branch and some other repository
tracking information if a Git repository exists in any particular directory on
the current working directory.

## Usage

-	To install the PS1 customization

	```bash
	$ ./install # This script is located in the dotfiles/customize-ps1 directory
	$ source "$HOME/.bashrc" # So that changes reflect in the current terminal
	```

-	To disable the PS1 customization

	```bash
	$ ./disable # This script is located in the dotfiles/customize-ps1 directory
	$ source "$HOME/.bashrc" # So that changes reflect in the current terminal
	```

## Notes

-	The disable script does not remove the function added to the `.bashrc` file.
	It only removes the function call in the `.bashrc` file, effectively
	disabling the prompt customization.
-	The main logic for displaying the current Git branch name and repository
	status is in [the `git-prompt.sh` file](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh)
	that Git generously provides in its GitHub repository.
	-	The `git-prompt.sh` file has all the available options and other details
		explained in a comment at the start of the script.
